<h2>Without Clearfix</h2>

<p>This image is floated to the right. It is also taller than the element containing it, so it overflows outside of its container:</p>

<div>
  <img class="img1" src="bird.jpg" alt="bird" width="170" height="170">
  Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves characterised by feathers,
     toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, ...

</div>

<h2 style="clear:right">With Clearfix</h2>
<p>We can fix this by adding a clearfix class with overflow: auto; to the containing element:</p>

<div class="clearfix">
  <img class="img2" src="bird.jpg" alt="bird" width="170" height="170">
  Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves characterised by feathers,
     toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, ...</p>
</div>
